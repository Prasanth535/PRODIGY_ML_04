# PRODIGY_ML_04
This repository contains a machine learning project focusing on hand gesture recognition. The project is a part of the "PRODIGY_ML" series, designed to experiment with different machine learning models.

##**Project Overview** 
The goal of this project is to build a model that recognizes hand gestures using machine learning techniques. The model is trained on data representing different hand gestures and aims to classify them correctly.

**You can install all the required libraries using the following command**: pip install -r requirements.txt

**Clone this repository to your local machine**: git clone https://github.com/Prasanth535/PRODIGY_ML_04.git
**Results**
The results of the trained model, including accuracy and confusion matrix, are displayed at the end of the notebook.
